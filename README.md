# Novel term proposed by Partha Partim Ray and Poulami Majumder first time in the world.

The novel article entitled "An Introduction to Pervasive Biomedical Informatics" coins the novel term "Pervasive Biomedical Informatics (PBI)" first time in the world. The novel paper was published in CSI Communications, July 2019, pp 33-34, Computer Society of India (CSI). 


# Brief about PBI: 

Pervasive Biomedical Informatics (PBI) is a novel domain of research that is combined of pervasive computing, biomedical engineering and informatics. In this article we coin the “Pervasive Biomedical Informatics” to design and imply a new area that could bring a new horizon in smart healthcare system. To know about this term first we should know about each part of
this term. Pervasive means anything at anytime, anywhere. It helps to make effective communication in every useful
device like laptop, mobile or smart devices by using computational method to minimize the need of interaction with
computer. Pervasive computing devices are network connected and constantly available.
